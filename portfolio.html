                <p>A digital marketing plan serves a business purpose. Starting with a clearly written objective, a business plan should outline the goals, risks, resources needed, budget, and a high-level concept of the plan. On a campaign-by-campaign basis, this is often represented as a creative brief. The plan should be easy to read, and most of all it should be clear and concise in the business objectives. For an enterprise digital marketing plan, a Plan of Action (POA) is a must. A well-documented POA gets the nod from the management team, and also serves as a “blueprint” for execution. overall it's a very effective experience to beginning build up my career on it.</p>
